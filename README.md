This is a basic text-based blackjack game I made for a programming class. It should work on all operating systems, however I have not tested it on MacOS.

Make sure to download all the files into one folder, not just Blackjack.py. If you don't, it might not run properly.

If you don't want to deal with the hassle of downloading all the files and installing requirements and all that, just run the executable (I'll compile one for windows soon, but only Linux support for now.)
